We report additional insights considering the role of the lens gradient-index (GRIN) profile in third-order ocular aberrations, since this profile changes through life. Thus, we have calculated the contribution of that profile to the ocular aberrations with aging by applying the Seidel third-order theory of tilted and decentered elements, and by using a schematic-eye model. The results show the GRIN profile is needed to account for the decoupling of the aberrations between the cornea and the lens because the geometrical changes of the ocular surfaces with aging are not enough. Therefore, the current developments of aging human-eye models, as well as the experimental studies, cannot neglect the changes of the lens GRIN structure through life when modelling mechanisms of the compensation of ocular aberrations.},

  abstract = {The propagation of light within a gradient index (GRIN) media can be analyzed with the use of differential equations for a given non-homogenous refractive index profile. Numerical methods are often necessary to perform ray-tracing in GRIN media; however, analytical solutions exist for several types of GRIN lenses. In this paper, paraxial and non-paraxial differential equations are derived to calculate the ray path in a GRIN lens. It is shown that the paraxial equation has an analytical solution for a GRIN media with a quadratic profile within the paraxial region. The analytical solution can be obtained by using Legendre polynomials or by the Frobenius method involving a power series. Using the Legendre or Frobenius solution, one can calculate the refractive indices along the ray path. A new recursive relationship is proposed to map the trajectory of light at finite heights. To illustrate the finite ray-tracing method utilizing a non-paraxial differential equation, two lenses (with spherical and elliptical iso-indicial contours) are considered. The lenses' back focal distances, for rays entering the lenses at varying finite heights, are calculated. For each lens, its spherical aberration is estimated. The effective focal length and the shape of the principal surface are also obtained. The accuracy of the results is then compared to the numerical ray-tracing using an optical design software, Zemax OpticStudio. The predicted spherical aberration for the spherical lens differs from numerical ray-tracing by less than               {$\lambda$}               14 at the marginal zone, while the error for the effective focal length is less than               {$\lambda$}               100.},

The wide-field model incorporates a gradient-index (GRIN) lens, which enables it to fulfill properties of two well-known schematic eye models, namely, Navarro's model for off-axis aberrations and Thibos's chromatic on-axis model (the Indiana eye). These two models are based on extensive experimental data, which makes the derived wide-field eye model also consistent with that data. A mathematical method to construct a GRIN lens with its iso-indicial contours following the optical surfaces of given asphericity is presented. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated with three variants related to different age groups. The role of the GRIN structure in relation to the lens paradox is analyzed. The wide-field model with a GRIN lens can be used as a starting design for the eye inverse problem, i.e., reconstructing the optical structure of the eye from off-axis wavefront measurements. Anatomically more accurate age-dependent optical models of the eye could ultimately help an optical designer to improve wide-field retinal imaging.},

  abstract = {Mathematical Theory of Optics by Dr. Rudolf K. Luneburg stands as a monumental work in the field of optical theory, offering a rigorous and innovative approach to understanding instrumental optics through the lens of Maxwell's electromagnetic equations. First presented as a lecture series at Brown University in 1944, and later refined into these notes, Luneburg's work connects geometrical optics and scalar diffraction optics as systematic extensions of electromagnetic theory. This unification was groundbreaking, as these disciplines were previously treated as distinct fields. Luneburg's formulation of geometrical optics as exact solutions to Maxwell's equations, rather than simply as asymptotic approximations, redefined the theoretical landscape and laid the groundwork for future developments in optics. The volume meticulously explores topics such as Hamilton's theory of geometrical optics, the mathematical treatment of optical aberrations, and the now-famous Luneburg lens, which has become a key component in microwave antenna technology. Later chapters delve into diffraction theory, introducing Luneburg diffraction integrals that extend classical results and address complex problems such as resolution improvements. With additional appendices and notes by prominent scholars, the book not only consolidates Luneburg's profound insights but also enriches the field with practical applications and theoretical advancements. Recognized as one of the most significant contributions to optical theory, this volume remains a foundational text for physicists and engineers engaged in advanced optical research.

Models and data often show good match but also some paradoxes. The optical design seems to correspond to a wide angle lens. Compared to conventional optical systems, the eye presents a poor optical quality on axis, but a relatively good quality off-axis, thus yielding higher homogeneity for a wide visual field. This seems the result of an intriguing combination of the symmetry design principle with a total lack of rotational symmetry, decentrations and misalignments of the optical surfaces.

  abstract = {We present the formulation of a paraxial ray transfer or ABCD matrix for onion-type GRIN lenses. In GRIN lenses, each iso-indicial surface (IIS) can be considered a refracting optical surface. If each IIS is a shell or layer, the ABCD matrix of a GRIN lens is computed by multiplying a typically high number of translation and refraction matrices corresponding to the K layers inside the lens. Using a differential approximation for the layer thickness, this matrix product becomes a sum. The elements A, B, C, and D of the approximated GRIN ray transfer matrix can be calculated by integrating the elements of a single-layer matrix. This ABCD matrix differs from a homogeneous lens matrix in only one integration term in element C, corresponding to the GRIN contribution to the lens power. Thus the total GRIN lens power is the sum of the homogeneous lens power and the GRIN contribution, which offers a compact and simple expression for the ABDC matrix. We then apply this formulation to the crystalline lens and implement both numerical and analytical integration procedures to obtain the GRIN lens power. The analytical approximation provides an accurate solution in terms of Gaussian hypergeometric functions. Last, we compare our numerical and analytical procedures with published ABCD matrix methods in the literature, and analyze the effect of the iso-indicial surface's conic constant (Q) and inner curvature gradient (G) on the lens power for different lens models.},

  abstract = {The refractive power of a lens is determined largely by its surface curvatures and the refractive index of its medium. These properties can also be used to control the sharpness of focus and hence the image quality. One of the most effective ways of doing this is with a gradient index. Eye lenses of all species, thus far, measured, are gradient index (GRIN) structures. The index gradation is one that increases from the periphery of the lens to its centre but the steepness of the gradient and the magnitudes of the refractive index vary so that the optics of the lens accords with visual demands. The structural proteins, the crystallins, which create the index gradient, also vary from species to species, in type and relative distribution across the tissue. The crystallin classes do not contribute equally to the refractive index, and this may be related to their structure and amino acid content. This article compares GRIN forms in eye lenses of varying species, the relevance of these forms to visual requirements, and the relationship between refractive index and the structural proteins. Consideration is given to the dynamics of a living lens, potential variations in the GRIN form with physiological changes and the possible link between discontinuities in the gradient and growth. Finally, the property of birefringence and the characteristic polarisation patterns seen in highly ordered crystals that have also been observed in specially prepared eye lenses are described and discussed.},
