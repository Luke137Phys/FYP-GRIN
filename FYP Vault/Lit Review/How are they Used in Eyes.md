> The GRIN profile of the eye is constructed from a radial GRIN profile in the equatorial plane (it varies with respect to perpendicular distance from OA) and an axial GRIN profile along the optical axis.


> [!NOTE] Various Eyes
> To our knowledge, all eyes that have been examined thus far follow an inhomogeneous index with the function of refractive index varying across the various species with respect to their environmental and biological needs.


### Human Eye:


As mentioned the human eye is constructed from a radial GRIN profile in the equatorial plane and axial profile in the saggital plane.

A 4th order polynomial equation was derived to model the GRIN profile of the eye in the equatorial plane. [[Pierscionek2012]]. 

In the saggital plane is often modelled using half concentric elliptic IIC [[Liou1997]]. In order to maintain continuity it was shown [[Navarro2009]] that the central interface must also be a conicoid surface, rather than a flat plane.

### GRIN Distribution of the Eye

"There is a general consensus that the refractive index of the lens seems to increase monotonically from the surface to the center and also that the GRIN structure increases the refractive power of the lens" [[Pierscionek2012]]. The model for this refractive index distribution can be modelled using either spherical, elliptic or hyperbolic iso-indicial contours.

The correct values for GRIN coefficients and equation choice is presented in [[Goncharov2007]] and [[Flynn2024]]. These give realistic values for GRIN coefficients for a young healthy eye.
