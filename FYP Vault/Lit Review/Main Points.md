 1. [[GRIN Lenses]]
	- Definition
	- Examples of GRIN Mediums

2. [[How are they Used in Eyes]]
	- Crystalline Lens
	- Iso-indicial contours
		- [[Aberrations]]
	

3. [[Maths of the lens]]
	- $n_1,n_3,n_4$
	- Discrete vs Continuous Eye Models
	- Ray Tracing
	- Conor Equation

4. [[Why do we need a better eye model?]]
	- Intra Ocular Lens (IOL)
	- Replace Crystaline lens after caracts
	- Studying Eye Sight (far/near sighted)

#### Most important points for the project:
- Lens is represented by a GRIN model of two hyperbolic lenses
- A continuous method is much more accurate at modelling GRIN lenses efficiently
- The analytic/semi analytic approach is better than the numerical way of solving.
- Creating and accurate anatomically correct schematic eye model is important in the implementation of intra-ocular lenses and refractive surgery.
