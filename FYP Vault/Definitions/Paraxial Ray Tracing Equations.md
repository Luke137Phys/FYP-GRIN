### The ray tracing equations are:

$$n_{j+1}u_{j+1}=n_ju_j-h_jF_j$$
$$F_j=\frac{n_{j+1}n_j}{R_j}$$
$$h_{j+1}=h_j+d_{j+1}u_{j+1}$$

where:
- $n_j$ is the refractive index of $jth$ surface
- $u_j$ is the convergence angle after the $jth$ surface
- $h_j$ is the height that the ray enters the $(j+1)th$ surface of the lens
- $F_j$ is the power of the $jth$ lens surface
- $R_j$ is the radius of curvature of the $jth$ lens surface, or iso-indicial contour
- $d_j$ is the distance between the $jth$ and $(j+1)th$ surfaces, this can be written as $\Delta z$ to show change along the optical axis.
