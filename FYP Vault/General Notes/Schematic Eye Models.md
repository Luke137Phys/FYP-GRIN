There haven been multiple schematic eye models developed over the years. Each one has useful applications, however they are lacking in certain properties or are not completely accurate.

An accurate schematic GRIN model of the eye would allow for reconstruction of the eye through inverse ray tracing methods. **(Add reference to Sasha paper here)**

# Liou and Brennan Model

In their paper ([[Liou1997]]) published in 1997, Liou and Brennan presented an anatomically accurate schematic model of the human eye using a GRIN lens system.
