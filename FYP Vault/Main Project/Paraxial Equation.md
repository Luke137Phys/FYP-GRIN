 The [[# Differential Equations#Paraxial Differential Equation|Paraxial Differential Equation]] can be solved using the Frobenius method to get the infinite sum solution:
 $$h(z)=\sum_{m=0}^\infty a_mz^m + \sum_{m=0}^\infty b_mz^{m+1}$$
	
Using this in the paraxial region with $h_0<<1$ and  $u_0=0$ the following values for EFL and BFD are found:

$$EFL= 12.9885,$$
$$BFD=15.7942.$$
